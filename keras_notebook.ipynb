    "In this assignment you will explore medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will walk through some of the steps of building and evaluating this deep learning classifier model. In particular, you will:\n",
    "- Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset.\n",
    "- Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification.\n",
    "- Learn a technique to handle class imbalance\n",
    "- Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve.\n",
    "- Visualize model activity using GradCAMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In completing this assignment you will learn about the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data preparation\n",
    "  - Visualizing data.\n",
    "  - Preventing data leakage.\n",
    "- Model Development\n",
    "  - Addressing class imbalance.\n",
    "  - Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning.\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "  - AUC and ROC curves."
